## **What is a license?**

A license is an agreement that allows someone or something to use a service or perform an action as long as they agree to the terms provided in an agreement.
In a license there are two parts: the licensor and the client. Both must accept the conditions for the deal to be closed. The conditions are those that will be explained below.
- Object of contract
- Price and method of payment
- Extension of the license 
- Responsibility
- Warranty
- Intellectual property
- Confidentiality
- Resolution:
- Jurisdiction and applicable regulations


## **What is a software license?**

A software license is a contract between the licensor and the licensee of the computer program, to use it complying with a series of terms and conditions established within its clauses, that is, it is a set of permissions that a developer can grant to a user in those who have the possibility of distributing, using or modifying the product under a certain license.

## **What types of license are there?**

### Free Software:

First of all, to say that free software normally has no cost, although this is not always true. Once this is seen, it is necessary to put a little in context of where this idea comes from

[![IMAGE](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Richard_Matthew_Stallman.jpeg/220px-Richard_Matthew_Stallman.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SdPLG-_wtA)

For software to be free has to accomplish these four freedoms:
- **Use**: Run the program as you want.
- **Study**: Be able to analyse the source code of the program and change it so that the program does what you want.
- **Distribute**: The freedom to distribute copies, being able to help others.
- **Improve**: The freedom to make and distribute copies of your modified versions of the program.

|Advantage|Disadvantages|
|:---------:|:---------:|
|Constant updates|No guarantee by the author|
|Reduced cost|Little market structure|

### Open source:
In 1998 a group of people, among them Bruce Perens or Eric Steven Raymond, created open source, in protest against the ethics that Richard Stallman wanted to transmit. While it is true that both free software and open source want to reach the same goal, get the open code succeed more than the private, they do it in different ways.
While it is true that open source seeks more excellence, free software focuses more on user learning.

    To get a code to be open source you must pass these 10 requirements:
    -	Free redistribution
    -	Source code
    -	Derived works
    -	Integrity of the source code of the author
    -	Without discrimination of persons or groups
    -	Distribution of the license
    -	The license must not be specific to a product
    -	The license must not restrict other software
    -	The license must be technologically neutral


### Copyleft:
When someone does a work automatically, they generate the author's rights, whether they want it or not. This is where copyleft appears.
The copyleft is a legal strategy, "hack", is the strategy of reversing the restrictions established by copyright or copyright regulations. Applying copyleft, the only restriction imposed is that of not restricting.
For example, if someone creates an open code and applies the copyleft, anyone can access this code, either to study or improve it. Once the new user has a new code and publishes it, that new code will have the same copyleft license, protecting the code so that it remains open.

### BSD:
The BSD license is one of the most permissive that imposes few restrictions. One of the advantages is the power to market the software freely.
Example of BSD license extracted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses):

### MIT:

Example of BSD license extracted from [open source](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
Copyright <YEAR> <COPYRIGHT HOLDER>

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

### MPL:
Very similar to the BSD, this forces you to deliver the code to the original creator with the modifications.

### Software with Public Domain:
Some say that it can be classified outside of the licenses, since it can be distributed without any type of restriction.

### Software Semi-free:
As with most licenses, it also allows the user who receives it to copy or even modify it. However, you are not allowed to earn money.

### Shareware:
The shareware license allows the user to use the programs for a limited or unlimited time but with restrictions. Therefore this license can be subdivided into:
- **Trial:** is the name of the payment license that is given to a program that offers all its functions but only for a limited time, forcing the user to buy the license once the time expires.
- **Demo:** The demo concept offers the user, for an unlimited time, most software functions.
- **Adware:** Are the programs that have all their active functions in exchange for downloading advertising or do not offer their latest version, which needs to be purchased.

### Commercial Software License:

For the owner's license, the user pays not to get the program but his activation license. This software does not belong to you, so you can not change the source code. Apart from this limitation, it can not be distributed without the permission of its owner.
This software can be obtained in more than one way:
- **In a single payment**: The case of Windows, the user pays when buying the computer and in case an update is removed, the Windows that user has will be updated without any cost.
- **Monthly**: Programs such as Creative Cloud, when hiring this service the user is given the license to access all their programs for a certain amount of time. Once it expires, you must pay again if you want to continue using them.

|Advantage|Disadvantages|
|:---------:|:---------:|
|Ease of acquisition| Unable to copy|
| Greater compatibility with the software |  The cost of the application is greater| 
|Greater protection of copyrighted works|It can not be modified|
