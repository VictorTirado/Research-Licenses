## **What is a license?**

A license is an agreement that allows someone or something to use a service or perform an action as long as they agree to the terms provided in an agreement.
In a license there are two parts: the licensor and the client. Both must accept the conditions for the deal to be closed. The conditions are those that will be explained below

## **What is a software license?**

A software license is a contract between the licensor and the licensee of the computer program, to use it complying with a series of terms and conditions established within its clauses, that is, it is a set of permissions that a developer can grant to a user in those who have the possibility of distributing, using or modifying the product under a certain license.

## **What types of license are there?**

### Free Software:

First of all, to say that free software normally has no cost, although this is not always true. Once this is seen, it is necessary to put a little in context of where this [idea comes from](<iframe width="1519" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8SdPLG-_wtA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>).

For software to be free has to accomplish these four freedoms:
- **Use**: Run the program as you want.
- **Study**: Be able to analyse the source code of the program and change it so that the program does what you want.
- **Distribute**: The freedom to distribute copies, being able to help others.
- **Improve**: The freedom to make and distribute copies of your modified versions of the program.


### Open source:
In 1998 a group of people, among them Bruce Perens or Eric Steven Raymond, created open source, in protest against the ethics that Richard Stallman wanted to transmit. While it is true that both free software and open source want to reach the same goal, get the open code succeed more than the private, they do it in different ways.
While it is true that open source seeks more excellence, free software focuses more on user learning.

To get a code to be open source you must pass these 10 requirements:
-	Free redistribution
-	Source code
-	Derived works
-	Integrity of the source code of the author
-	Without discrimination of persons or groups
-	Distribution of the license
-	The license must not be specific to a product
-	The license must not restrict other software
-	The license must be technologically neutral


### Copyleft
When someone does a work automatically, they generate the author's rights, whether they want it or not. This is where copyleft appears.
The copyleft is a legal strategy, "hack", is the strategy of reversing the restrictions established by copyright or copyright regulations. Applying copyleft, the only restriction imposed is that of not restricting.
For example, if someone creates an open code and applies the copyleft, anyone can access this code, either to study or improve it. Once the new user has a new code and publishes it, that new code will have the same copyleft license, protecting the code so that it remains open.
