## **What is a license?**

A license is an agreement that allows someone or something to use a service or perform an action as long as they agree to the terms provided in an agreement.
In a license there are two parts: the licensor and the client. Both must accept the conditions for the deal to be closed. The conditions are those that will be explained below.
- Object of contract
- Price and method of payment
- Extension of the license 
- Responsibility
- Warranty
- Intellectual property
- Confidentiality
- Resolution
- Jurisdiction and applicable regulations


## **What is a software license?**

A software license is a contract between the licensor and the licensee of the computer program, to use it complying with a series of terms and conditions established within its clauses, that is, it is a set of permissions that a developer can grant to a user in those who have the possibility of distributing, using or modifying the product under a certain license.

## **What types of software license are there?**

### Free Software:

First of all, to say that free software normally has no cost, although this is not always true. Once this is seen, it is necessary to put a little in context of where this idea comes from

[![IMAGE](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Richard_Matthew_Stallman.jpeg/220px-Richard_Matthew_Stallman.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SdPLG-_wtA)

For software to be free has to accomplish these four freedoms:
- **Use**: Run the program as you want.
- **Study**: Be able to analyse the source code of the program and change it so that the program does what you want.
- **Distribute**: The freedom to distribute copies, being able to help others.
- **Improve**: The freedom to make and distribute copies of your modified versions of the program.

|Advantage|Disadvantages|
|:---------:|:---------:|
|Constant updates|No guarantee by the author|
|Reduced cost|Little market structure|

### Open source:
In 1998 a group of people, among them Bruce Perens or Eric Steven Raymond, created open source, in protest against the ethics that Richard Stallman wanted to transmit. While it is true that both free software and open source want to reach the same goal, get the open code succeed more than the private, they do it in different ways.
While it is true that open source seeks more excellence, free software focuses more on user learning.

    To get a code to be open source you must pass these 10 requirements:
    -	Free redistribution
    -	Source code
    -	Derived works
    -	Integrity of the source code of the author
    -	Without discrimination of persons or groups
    -	Distribution of the license
    -	The license must not be specific to a product
    -	The license must not restrict other software
    -	The license must be technologically neutral


### Copyleft:
When someone does a work automatically, they generate the author's rights, whether they want it or not. This is where copyleft appears.
The copyleft is a legal strategy, "hack", is the strategy of reversing the restrictions established by copyright or copyright regulations. Applying copyleft, the only restriction imposed is that of not restricting.
For example, if someone creates an open code and applies the copyleft, anyone can access this code, either to study or improve it. Once the new user has a new code and publishes it, that new code will have the same copyleft license, protecting the code so that it remains open.

!["Copyleft"](https://blog.carreralinux.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/las-licencias-libres.png)

### GPL (General Public License):

The GPL license was made by Richard Stallman for the [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html) project. This license includes copyleft, so everyone will have the right to study such software, but once you have the new one and want to publish it, you will remain under that license.
Example of GPL license extracted from [choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/):

[program]  Copyright (C) [year] [name of author]

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.


### BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution):
The BSD license is one of the most permissive that imposes few restrictions. One of the advantages is the power to market the software freely.
Example of BSD license extracted from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses):

SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
 
### MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology):

The MIT license belongs to the free software group, in this permissive case, this means that it places very few limitations. Aside, it does not contain copyleft with what can be picked up by other users and modify it to put it to benefit.
Example of MIT license extracted from [open source](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT):

Copyright [YEAR] [COPYRIGHT HOLDER]

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

### Apache:
The Apache license like the MIT or BSD is permissive, that means that the user can modify or distribute. The only requirement that the license requests is that a notice be kept for new users announcing the use of Apache-licensed code.
Example of MPL extracted from [apache](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0):

Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]

### MPL (Mozilla Public License):
Very similar to the BSD, this forces you to deliver the code to the original creator with the modifications.
Example of MPL extracted from [eionet](https://www.eionet.europa.eu/software/license.html):

The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at 
http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/ 
Software distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF 
ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific language governing rights and 
limitations under the License. 
The Original Code is ______________________________________. 
The Initial Developer of the Original Code is ________________________. Portions created by

Contributor(s): ______________________________________. 
Alternatively, the contents of this file may be used under the terms of the _____ license (the  ?[___] License?), in which case the provisions of [______] License are applicable  instead of those above.  If you wish to allow use of your version of this file only under the terms of the [____] License and not to allow others to use your version of this file under the MPL, indicate your decision by deleting  the provisions above and replace  them with the notice and other provisions required by the [___] License.  If you do not delete the provisions above, a recipient may use your version of this file under either the MPL or the [___] License.

### Software with Public Domain:
Some say that it can be classified outside of the licenses, since it can be distributed without any type of restriction.

### Software Semi-free:
As with most licenses, it also allows the user who receives it to copy or even modify it. However, you are not allowed to earn money.

### Shareware:
The shareware license allows the user to use the programs for a limited or unlimited time but with restrictions. Therefore this license can be subdivided into:
- **Trial:** is the name of the payment license that is given to a program that offers all its functions but only for a limited time, forcing the user to buy the license once the time expires.
- **Demo:** The demo concept offers the user, for an unlimited time, most software functions.
- **Adware:** Are the programs that have all their active functions in exchange for downloading advertising or do not offer their latest version, which needs to be purchased.

![ARES](http://www.ares.com.es/themes/seo/ares.com.es/images/logo.png)

### Commercial Software License:

For the owner's license, the user pays not to get the program but his activation license. This software does not belong to you, so you can not change the source code. Apart from this limitation, it can not be distributed without the permission of its owner.
This software can be obtained in more than one way:
- **In a single payment**: The case of Windows, the user pays when buying the computer and in case an update is removed, the Windows that user has will be updated without any cost.
- **Monthly**: Programs such as Creative Cloud, when hiring this service the user is given the license to access all their programs for a certain amount of time. Once it expires, you must pay again if you want to continue using them.

|Advantage|Disadvantages|
|:---------:|:---------:|
|Ease of acquisition| Unable to copy|
| Greater compatibility with the software |  The cost of the application is greater| 
|Greater protection of copyrighted works|It can not be modified|

## IP's
In order to apply this concept in the field of videogames, we first need to know exactly what it means.
According to the WIPO, World Intellectual Property Organization, they define intellectual property (IP's) as:
Intellectual property refers to creations of the mind: inventions; literary and artistic works; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. Intellectual property is divided into two categories:
Industrial Property includes patents for inventions, trademarks, industrial designs and geographical indications.
Copyright covers literary works (such as novels, poems and plays), films, music, artistic works (e.g., drawings, paintings, photographs and sculptures) and architectural design.
Rights related to copyright include those of performing artists in their performances, producers of phonograms in their recordings, and broadcasters in their radio and television programs.
Now that we understand the concept of IP, why use it?
There are 3 compelling points to use it:
- **The progress of humanity to create new inventions.**
- **The legal protection of new creations.**
- **The promotion of IP's helps in economic growth, creating jobs.**
For more information about what they are and what they are used for [here](http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/intproperty/450/wipo_pub_450.pdf).

Once seen this, what types of IP's can we find?

Mainly you can find four types:
- **Patent:** A patent could be defined as inventing something new that helps to do something in an improved or new way. The patent is awarded to the developer of this new invention for a period of time, usually about 20.
- **Trade Secret:** They are the confidential secrets to get a product. Normally very few people know them given to a non-disclosure agreement.
As a clear example, the formula of Coca-Cola.
- **Copyright:**
- **Trademark:** They can be defined as brands, they are signs that help the customer to distinguish and buy what product they want.
It can be distinguished either by: words, slogans, letters, numbers, logos or numbers.
To be able to register a trademark at the national level by submitting an application for registration in the national trademark office. If you want to internationally, you must submit an application for trademark registration with the trademark office of each country or use the WIPO Madrid system, which can reach up to 117 countries.

Example of Trademark

You look at how the IP's go. You can also apply all this in the world of video games. It is said that an IP in video games is when the company creates a new game, this means that this game will have a music, characters, history, among other things only. As for example, it would be The last of Us.
An example which would not be the new Call of Duty, from the first is when the saga begins so all are covered under the same IP.
If the company is not able to produce any of the parts by itself, it will need the help of third parties, for which it must pay a license.

|Patent|Trade Secret|Copyright|Trademark| 
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|Hardware technical solutions|Customer mailing lists	| Music|Company name|
|Inventive game play or game design elements	| Pricing information|Code|Company logo|
|Technical innovations such as software, networking or database design	| Publisher contacts|Story|Game title|
|	|Middleware contacts|Company name|Game subtitle|
|	| Middleware contacts|Characters||
||Developer contacts|Art||
||Deal terms|Box design||
||In-house development tools|Website design||
